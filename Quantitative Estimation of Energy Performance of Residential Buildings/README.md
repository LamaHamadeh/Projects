Enhance the Energy Efficiency Performance of UCL Most Used Buildings Using Machine Learning.

***Abstract.***

Today, there is a growing interest in developing energy efficient buildings since it is estimated that buildings account for about 40% of the 
total primary energy consumption in the world. Specifically speaking, university buildings are ones of the busiest buildings especially during term 
times due to their large usage frequency. Machine learning, simply put, allows the user to feed a computer algorithm an immense amount of data and have 
the computer learn from the data, identify patterns, and make data-driven recommendations and decisions. This project aims, by using Python programming language, 
to build a multi-target regression machine learning model to predict the heating and cooling loads for several most used UCL buildings for the aim of enhancing
their energy performance during their busy times.

***Main steps.***

1. Read and understand the paper: 
Athanasios, T. and Angeliki, X., * *"Accurate quantitative estimation of energy performance of residential buildings using statistical machine learning tools", 
Energy and Buildings, Volume 49, June 2012, Pages 560-567. URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037877881200151X* *

2. Download the dataset from the * *Machine Learning Repository: Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems. 
URL: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Energy+efficiency* *

3. Familiarize yourself with Python programming language and download Anaconda software to use Jupyter Notebook as your main computational tool.

4. Familiarize yourself with the mathematics behind Linear and Multi-, and Multi-target Regression methods.

5. Understand the main steps that should be taken when building a machine learning model for a given dataset.

6. Build the model.

7. Obtain information from several UCL high populated/used buildings. In this step, you need to know the right people or places to contact to obtain 
such structural engineering information.

8. Pass the collected data into the regression model to accurately estimate (or predict) the heating and cooling loads of the chosen building for the aim 
of enhancing their energy efficiency performance.


***Software.***

Mainly, you will be using Python as a programming language to perform and apply the Machine Learning algorithm. This can be done using Jupyter Notebook 
application obtained from Anaconda distribution. If you are not familiar with it, let me know.
