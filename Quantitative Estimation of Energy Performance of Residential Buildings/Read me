Here we use multi-target regression machine learning model to quantitatively estimate the energy performance of residential buildings. 

The dataset was taken from the paper:

Athanasios, T. and Angeliki, X., "Accurate quantitative estimation of energy performance of residential buildings using statistical machine learning tools", Energy and Buildings, Volume 49, June 2012, Pages 560-567
