1- ***Stability of Time-Stepping Schemes*** : Basic time-stepping schemes, e.g., forward and backward Euler, involve discretisation in both space and time for time-dependent partial differential equations. Issues of numerical stability as the solution is propagated in time and accuracy from the space-time discretisation are of great concern for any implementation. The optimal choice of the time-stepping scheme depends on its purpose to obtain a time-accurate discretisation of a highly dynamic flow problem or to march the numerical solution to a steady state starting with some reasonable initial guess. Every scheme eventually leads to an iteration procedure which the computer can use to advance the solution in time. This project assesses the credibility of the solution and determines the ratio (or a number) that controls the accuracy and stability of the chosen scheme. Equations such as wave and heat differential equations are to be examined using MATLAB software.

2- ***Independent Component Analysis for Image Separation***: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical and computational technique for revealing hidden factors that underlie sets of random variables, measurements or signals. ICA can be seen as an extension to principal component analysis (PCA). What distinguishes ICA from other methods is that it looks for components that are both statistically independent, and non-Gaussian. Its applications are wide and varied and the data analysed by ICA could originate from many different application fields, including digital images and document databases, as well as economic indicators and psychometric measurements. The primary focus of this project will be the application of ICA in the context of digital image separation. The method proposed here is to separate two images relies on reversing the action of the singular value decomposition (SVD) method on two statistically independent images using MATLAB software.

3- ***Principal Component Analysis for face recognition***: Dimensionality reduction, typically achieved through a principal component analysis (PCA) or orthogonal mode decomposition (POD), has achieved remarkable success in providing a mathematical framework which is much more amenable to analysis. This has allowed a better characterisation of the physics, engineering or biological system of interest. PCA is an unsupervised learning method, which seeks to find natural clustering of data in a lower dimensional feature space, whose basis contains linearly, ordered, independent, orthonormal and uncorrelated vectors that correspond to the maximum-variance directions in the original space. Interestingly, PCA can be used in the context of the computer vision problem of human face recognition. The approach of using eigenfaces for recognition functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as “eigenfaces”, because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces. The projection operation characterises an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognise a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. This project uses MATLAB software to examine this method.

4- ***Numerical Analysis of Shallow-Water Equations (Solution to two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations with vorticity-stream-function Approach.)***: The world is governed by natural laws many of which can be expressed by a system of PDEs. An important example are the Nervier-Stokes equations that, together with the Continuity Equations form a system of 6 coupled PDEs which describe fluid flow in 3D. these equations are difficult to solve even approximately. This system can be simplified using The Shallow Water Equations (SWE). SWE are of fundamental interest in several contexts. In one sense, the ocean can be thought of as a shallow-water description over the surface of the Earth. The atmosphere can be also thought of as a relatively thin layer of fluid (gas) above the surface of the Earth. To understand the motion in the shallow-water limit, in this project, we will introduce the concept of a stream-function ψ and vorticity ω as dependent variables and how they are coupled to one another through the streamfunction-vorticity formulation and how to solve these equations numerically via MATLAB software using:  
1-Finite Difference Method  
2-Fourier Transform  
3-Chebychev Transform/Differentiation   

5- ***Numerical Analysis of Heat Equation***: Here we will solve the 1D and 2D heat transfer equation, i.e., diffusion equation, using two methods:   
1-Finite Difference Method  
2-Fourier Transform  
3-Chebychev Transform/Differentiation
